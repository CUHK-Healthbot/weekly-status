Xiaohongshu Data found so far:
- 3637 posts (deduplicated), 11064 images retrieved (364 images failed to retrieve, can try again)
- Json size: 7.7 MB
- Total image size: 5.0 GB
- Each keyword only gets about 150-200 posts before the app stops retrieving posts -> need a lot more keywords, or find a way to encourage the app to return more info
To do:
- Which keywords
- Check quality of posts
(Ideally 5000 training + 2000 testing)

Concern of X: Many bots exist now, bot may end up be trained on partly synthetic data
- authentic data is better and probably higher-quality
- filter as much as we can

(Might as well just synthetically generate some data of our own based on a sample?)
- technically feasible
- quality comes first

Can nutrition expert exams be good benchmarks/training data? (China, western)
- medical exams are often included in other research but quite specific
- see if we can get some exam data















Reddit 
- major benefit: upvotes/downvotes are representative of content importance and quality
- requires permission and fees are calculated on case-by-case basis
- cannot use for LLM training unless with explicit permission (unlikely to obtain? Probably need a lot of bargaining power)
